Stone Soup

Ingredients:
- 3 smooth, medium-sized river stones, thoroughly washed
- 4 cups fresh river water, ideally sourced from a clean, flowing stream
- 1 handful of wild grass, preferably young and tender
- 3-5 edible flowers, such as dandelions, violets, or clover blossoms
- 1 teaspoon of finely sifted soil, to enhance the mineral content
- 1 sturdy stick, lightly charred for depth of flavor
- A touch of fresh air, to enrich the natural essence

Instructions:
1. Select stones that are free of cracks or loose debris. Wash them thoroughly to remove any surface impurities.
2. Place the stones in a pot and cover them with fresh river water, ensuring they are fully submerged.
3. Bring the water to a gentle boil over an open fire, allowing the minerals from the stones to infuse into the liquid.
4. Gradually add the foraged grass, stirring occasionally to distribute the flavors evenly.
5. Introduce the edible flowers, gently pressing them into the broth to release their delicate floral notes.
6. Sprinkle in a small amount of sifted soil to provide an earthy depth to the soup’s profile.
7. Stir using the charred stick, which imparts a subtle smokiness.
8. Allow the soup to simmer until the aroma is balanced and inviting.
9. Once complete, serve immediately, appreciating the simplicity and purity of nature’s ingredients.
